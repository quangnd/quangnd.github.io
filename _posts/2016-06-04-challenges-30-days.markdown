Some best 30 day challenges YOU can take to bring some change in my life

**Go Offline.** First and foremost, forget about social media for a month. You will instantly notice how longer your day can be without it. This will let you literally maximize your time. Now your task is to use that time properly.

**Live Beyond Your Comfort Zone.** There is nothing new in your comfort zone. All the opportunities for growth are beyond it. Be bold enough to face your fears and enter your discomfort zone.

**Write 300 Words A Day.** Everyday writing will allow you to systematize your thoughts and let you express them in a more structured way. It is a great exercise for your brains and a challenge that is worth accepting.

**Enter Your Alone Zone.** Close the door, turn off your smartphone and enter your alone zone, where nobody can disturb you. Dedicate at least 30 minutes every day to thinking, analyzing, prioritizing.

**Collect Ideas.** Develop a habit to generate ideas: write down 5â€“10 new ideas for 30 days straight. This exercise will train your idea muscle. Moreover, at the end of the month you will have a decent amount of ideas that you can fulfill later.

**Work Out Daily.** Do physical exercises 30 days straight. You do not need to have long and exhausting workouts every single day. Nevertheless, make sure you do basic exercises at least 30 minutes a day.

**Get Up Early.** Develop the the habit to get up early and not to stay in your bed for long. Do the most important tasks from your list in the very morning and enjoy the rest of a day doing the things you love.
