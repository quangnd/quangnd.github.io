#1. Voting app

This is a fullstack React web app with NodeJS and its ecosystem. However, in this project, I don't use a backend system, I used fakeAPI for demo.

Please visit <a href="https://voting-fakeapi-mun.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">https://voting-fakeapi-mun.herokuapp.com/</a> to see online.

(Demo acc: **quangnd/quangnd**)

(Read Github readme file for more detail!)

Thanks!
